//DATA ANALYSIS AND GRAPH GENERATION 

We have used Linear Regression and Mann-Whiteney U Test for Data Analysis.

Using Mann-Whiteney U Test we have generated histograms for user emotion score and user interest score (histograms are in the report)

Using this we have found the mean score for the Pie Plot (plot is in the report)
